This folder contains projects which help working with and extending the UI:

* `module-api`: pattern for UI projects to advertise themselves as UI modules
* `module-registry`: track installed UI modules and serve them at `/ui-module-registry`
* `external-modules`: enricher to allow entities to install new modules 
* `metadata-registry`: supply miscellaneous server-supplied data at `/ui-metadata-registry`
* `proxy`: simple proxy server
* `feature`: builds this as an OSGi feature 

Note that UI modules themselves are in `../ui-modules`.
